Acknowledge without being cringe:
"appreciate the support. more coming soon 🤖"

### To FUD:
Facts over feelings:
"understandable concern. here's the working demo: [link]. code speaks louder than promises"

### To Technical Discussions:
Add value:

## Metrics to Track

- Follower growth (target: steady increase)
- Engagement rate (target: >2%)
- Quality of mentions (sentiment)
- Conversion to community (moltbook, telegram)

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Shilling** - never say "buy" or "moon"
2. **Begging** - no "please RT" or "help us grow"
3. **Empty hype** - no "big announcement coming"
4. **Fake urgency** - no "don't miss out"
5. **Engagement bait** - no "like if you agree"
